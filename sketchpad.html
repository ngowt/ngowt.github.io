                <p class="card-text">
                  While the Trillo project focused on utilizing Flexbox, the
                  Nexter project was solely dedicated on utilizing CSS's Grid
                  feature. I certainly know the pain of having to create
                  responsive grid layouts without Flexbox or CSS Grids. My
                  favourite part was a nifty trick you can do to create these
                  responsive grid tracks with the clever use of the minmax()
                  function along with autofit when defining your
                  grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Not only does this allow us to be flexible in displaying a
                  non-static number of columns/rows, but it is also responsive.
                  The auto-fit property creates as many tracks as possible given
                  a unit of size. It also collapses any leftover tracks and sets
                  the width to 0. Now when used with the minmax() function,
                  because of the minimum width, it will shift any tracks that
                  cannot fit in its current column/row into the next one. In the
                  case of leftover space, it is evenly distributed among the
                  tracks until the maximum width is reached, giving us the
                  "responsive" feel.

                  The purpose of this project was mainly to utilize CSS's
                  flexbox feature. After spending some time on it, I started to
                  instinctively feel the appropriate times to create a flexbox
                  container.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The theory behind it might take some time to get used to
                  especially remembering whether to use justify-content or
                  align-items, but I managed to beat it into my head that
                  justify-content deals with aligning elements on the main-axis
                  while align-items deals with aligning elements on the
                  cross-axis.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Heres another clever I found of remembering it according to an
                  online stranger.

                  A line, align, get it? (*Insert forced laughter). I think my
                  favourite part of this project was when I found out how simple
                  Flexbox could be in creating responsive layouts. For example,
                  on desktop viewport sizes, you may want to set your flex
                  container on a navigation menu to be horizontal but change it
                  to vertical for tablet/phone. Its amazing!

                  The purpose of the Natours project is to get deep into CSS. I
                  already had an idea of how specificity works, but it was quite
                  enlightening to learn what happens to CSS when we open up a
                  website.

                  <li>
                    The HTML document is parsed into the DOM (Document Object
                    Model)
                  </li>
                  <li>Meanwhile, CSS is loaded</li>
                  <li>
                    CSS is then parsed into the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) and the
                    final values of each properties are resolved via. a detailed
                    process called "The Cascade" (hence the 'C' in CSS)
                  </li>
                  <li>The DOM and the CSSOM form the "Render Tree"</li>
                  <li>
                    The browser then utilizes the "Visual Formatting Model" to
                    render the page based off the "Render Tree"
                  </li>
                  <li>User sees final rendered website</li>

                  I was also introduced to the 7-1 design pattern for organizing

                  Finally, I got a chance to use a CSS proprocessor (SCSS in

                  features missing from old school vanilla CSS such as variables
                  and shorthand & notation. I also got a much better
                  understanding of writing BEM (block__element--modifier)
                  notation compared to my previous attempt at the product

                <p class="card-text">
                  Photolytics is something that I wanted to build ever since I
                  blundered pretty hard on that web development final project
                  during my college days. BUT, I feel that I managed to rectify
                  that failure here with this project.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I used SemanticUI to build my UI components since I wanted to
                  try something else aside from the widely known Bootstrap
                  framework. Although now having used it and a few other UI
                  frameworks, I can pretty much say they are all essentially the
                  same. The design of the cards were based off the posts from
                  Instagram while the waterfall grid layout was something
                  similar to imgur. Overall I was quite pleased with how the
                  waterfall layout and individual components turned out.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  However, I was a bit disappointed with how much control I had
                  over implementing certain animations in ReactJS. For example,
                  I wanted to to play certain animations when components were
                  unmounted. Easy enough, with Animate.CSS, I will just append a
                  className to the component on the componentWillUnmount()
                  lifecycle method and it should work right? Well as you can
                  guess, this doesn't play out as intended since you can't
                  really play an animation on something that no longer exists
                  (who knew?). The solution here would be to delay the
                  unmounting until after the animation has finished playing.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For the image columns, I implemented a round-robin system to
                  distribute the images one at a time to each column. So when my
                  infinite pagination feature came around, it worked perfectly
                  to distribute the next series of images to each column.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Okay, well maybe not entirely perfectly, because with this
                  came another problem. Ironically in order to create the
                  "waterfall" layout, the height of each card needed to be
                  varying in size and while it worked nicely with my round-robin
                  distribution algorithm, you would get some cases where one
                  column would be much longer than the others. I guess maybe
                  next time, I'll allocate elements based on how much space each
                  column is occupying.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Stemming from the calculator project, I wanted to delve more
                  into CSS and research how it actually worked. In this project,
                  I applied CSS's flexbox feature to build various responsive
                  sections.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It was also at this point I was introduced to writing CSS in
                  BEM (block__element--modifier) notation and wanted to apply it
                  here as well. Although looking back, I got the syntax entirely
                  wrong as well as how you are suppose to name the "blocks" and
                  "elements". But at least I got the concept!

                  Yes, I know that building a calculator is probably the
                  equivalent of your first year comp sci project. But the
                  purpose of this was to develop a solid understanding of how
                  state and property passing works between parent and child
                  components in ReactJS.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  At this point, I was also getting curious about the blackbox
                  that was CSS. Not only did I want to code functionality behind
                  components, I also wanted to make them look visually
                  appealing. So I just started off with Flexbox since it seemed
                  like a clean way of getting a beautifully spaced component up
                  and running. Bootstrap was a nice starting point since the
                  framework abstracts the functionality of writing the .CSS code
                  behind the class names.

                  I remember when I completed this, I felt pretty happy

                  were a lot of problems with it. For example, incomplete
                  classes, giant if-else blocks, and lack of OAuth with steam
                  and styling. I think sometime in the future, I will dedicate a
                  blog post entirely to this.
