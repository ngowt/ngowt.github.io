              My story
            </h4>
            <p class="lead mb-3">
              Looking back, the first time I was ever exposed to programming was
              when I was in the 5th grade and picked up a copy of “C++ For
              Dummies” from my local library. Unfortunately, I was unable to
              grasp a single concept at the time. I would encounter something
              similar when I signed up for a programming course in high school.
              However, instead of C++, we were learning Visual Basic instead.
              Nonetheless, the results were similar.
              <br />
              <br />
              I eventually found myself focusing more onto sciences and
              eventually enrolled in the University of Waterloo for
              Biochemistry. However, this too would not last long as my interest
              in science had slowly been worn away. It was one day at the
              University library that my curiosity led me to the computer
              science section and I picked out an old hardcover book. The book
              was an introduction to programming with Java. Upon reading it, I
              felt the topics covered and explanations made perfect sense to me.
              So I went back day after day to read it while disregarding my
              responsibilities as a biochemistry student. At that point, I only
              cared about what else I would learn from that book.
              <br />
              <br />
              I eventually withdrew from the University of Waterloo to enroll at
              Sheridan College to pursue a career in software development and I
              loved it. Time after time, I would see blank projects slowly take
              form and as I invested more and more time, the more “perfect” it
              would look and hence, the more rewarding it felt.
              <br />
              <br />
              So now I seek to apply this principle whenever and wherever I can.
              In doing so, I have opened myself up to a diverse set of tools,
              frameworks, and design patterns that allows me to accomplish my
              goal as a front end developer in an effective way.

              Interests
            </h4>
            <p class="lead mb-3 ">
              Aside from web development, I love to read a good fiction book.
              Some of my favourites include "Do Androids Dream of Electric
              Sheep?" by Philip K. Dick and "The Trial" by Franz Kafka.
              <br />
              <br />
              Apart of me never grew up and still loves games. Some of my
              favourites included Starcraft II, Defense of the Ancients, as well
              as the Fire Emblem series. While nowadays I don't have the time to
              play games as often, I still appreciate the story, characters, and
              art behind them as well as the individuals and teams who created
              them. It was also because of this, I was very fond of game
              development.
              <br />
              <br />
              For me, the great outdoors is something to behold and experience
              for oneself. A long hike to the top of any mountain is a test of
              one's endurance and the view is the reward. The sights we take in
              when we explore lakes, forests, volcanoes, deserts, mountains and
              canyons are shaped over millions of years--some of which are listed by UNESCO as having special cultural or physical significance.
